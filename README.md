  - Multiple LoRAs with weights (supports `<lora:name:weight>` and JSON formats)
- Support for both PNG parameters and JPG UserComment metadata
- Responsive GUI with PyQt6
- Dark/Light mode, automatically detects system theme
- Save metadata to TXT files
- Supports imageview orientation (landscape/portrait)
